<p>
  
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.yale.edu/">Yale University</a>, where I am privileged to be advised by Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/cai/">Yang Cai</a>. I have a broad interest in theoretical computer science, with a particular focus on algorithmic game theory.

<p>

I received my B.Sc. in Computer Science from Turing Class, <a href="https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/">CFCS, Peking University</a>. Throughout my undergraduate studies, it was my great fortune to work with and receive guidance from Prof. <a href="http://zhihaotang.com/">Zhihao Tang</a>, Prof. <a href="https://www.fuhuthu.com/">Hu Fu</a>, and Prof. <a href="https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/">Yuqing Kong</a>.
